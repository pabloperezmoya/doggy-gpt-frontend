# 🐶 Doggy GPT (using React⚛️)

This is an implementation of a chatbot using OpenAI API, called Doggy GPT. 

Obviously, this project is linked with the [DoggyGPT-backend 🎒](https://github.com/pabloperezmoya/doggy-gpt) repository.

This project was created for educational purposes and uses React⚛️, Sass💅, HTML🏗️ and JavaScript💛.

During this project, I learned and practiced:

* React ⚛️ (the main purpose of the project was to keep learning this framework)
* Sass 💅 (CSS but with powers)
* Data Fetching 💿 (Connecting my backend (FastAPI) with this frontend)
